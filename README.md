# Seasons Tracker

This is the source for the Seasons Trcker pack for EmoTracker.

## How to Use

EmoTracker has a built in dev mode to use this code in that mode: 
- You will need to go to your EmoTracker folder and add a `dev` folder with the other folders
- Add a `packs` folder to that new `dev` folder
- clone this repo in packs
- start up Emotracker with a `-dev` (I just created a new shortcut and added it) 
Now any changes you make will be loaded into EmoTracker (from what I can tell, you do have to close EmoTracker and reopen it to get any new changes)
